Solving 9*9 sudoku puzzle

Sudoku is basically a number-placement puzzle. 

In classic sudoku, the objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids that compose the grid (also called "boxes", "blocks", or "regions") contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.

The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution.
